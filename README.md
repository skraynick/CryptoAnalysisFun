### Work in Progress:
This is just an initial prototype. Currently, it just counts the letters (English only for now), 
more functionality will be added. Working at the moment to expand the statistical
tooling to differentiate between stream and block ciphers and so on. If you
have suggestions of functionality, send them my way. 

Thanks.

Happy Hacker.
